# Project/Goals

This project aims to provide comprehensive insights into Point of Interest (POI) information around Citybike stations, utilizing data from Yelp and Foursquare. The objectives are structured as follows:

## Data Collection
**Citybike Stations**: Gather data on Citybike station locations to serve as the foundation for POI analysis.
**Yelp and Foursquare Data**: Extract POI information related to Citybike stations from both Yelp and Foursquare platforms. This includes restaurants, bars, landmarks, parks, and more.

## Data Analysis and Comparison
**Comparing Yelp and Foursquare**: Analyze and compare the POI data obtained from Yelp and Foursquare. This comparison will highlight the strengths and coverage differences between the two sources.

## Visualization
**Result Visualization**: Utilize various visualization techniques to represent the data effectively. This will include maps for geographical data and charts to compare the POI information from Yelp and Foursquare.

## Data Management
**SQL Database**: Store, manage, and query the collected data using an SQL database. This will facilitate efficient data retrieval and manipulation for analysis.

## Statistical Modeling
**Regression Model**: Develop a regression model to understand the relationships between the availability of Citybike stations and the surrounding POIs. This model will help identify significant factors influencing bike station usage.
